A 3D-Printed Flexible Open-Source Microfluidic System, containing a double syringe pump, pressure sensor and back pressure regulator

In this work, we introduce a low-cost open-source flow system that includes a dual syringe pump with implemented pressure sensor and back pressure regulator. The entire system can be built for around 500 â‚¬.
